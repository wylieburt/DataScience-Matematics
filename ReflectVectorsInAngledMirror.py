# GRADED FUNCTION
# You should edit this cell.

# In this function, you will return the transformation matrix T,
# having built it out of an orthonormal basis set E that you create from Bear's Basis
# and a transformation matrix in the mirror's coordinates TE.
verySmallNumber = 1e-14 # That's 1×10⁻¹⁴ = 0.00000000000001

def gsBasis(A) :
    B = np.array(A, dtype=np.float_) # Make B as a copy of A, since we're going to alter it's values.
    # Loop over all vectors, starting with zero, label them with i
    for i in range(B.shape[1]) :
        # Inside that loop, loop over all previous vectors, j, to subtract.
        for j in range(i) :
            # Complete the code to subtract the overlap with previous vectors.
            # you'll need the current vector B[:, i] and a previous vector B[:, j]
            B[:, i] = B[:, i] - B[:, i] @ B[:, j] * B[:, j]
        # Next insert code to do the normalisation test for B[:, i]
        if la.norm(B[:, i]) > verySmallNumber :
            B[:, i] = B[:, i] / la.norm(B[:, i])
        else :
            B[:, i] = np.zeros_like(B[:, i])

    # Finally, we return the result:
    return B

def build_reflection_matrix(bearBasis) : # The parameter bearBasis is a 2×2 matrix that is passed to the function.
    # Use the gsBasis function on bearBasis to get the mirror's orthonormal basis.
    E = gsBasis(bearBasis)
    # Write a matrix in component form that performs the mirror's reflection in the mirror's basis.
    # Recall, the mirror operates by negating the last component of a vector.
    # Replace a,b,c,d with appropriate values
    TE = np.array([[1, 0],
                   [0, -1]])
    # Combine the matrices E and TE to produce your transformation matrix.
    T = E @ TE @ inv(E)

    # Finally, we return the result. There is no need to change this line.
    return T
